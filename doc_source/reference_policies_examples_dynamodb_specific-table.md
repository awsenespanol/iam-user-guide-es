# Amazon DynamoDB: Allows Access to a Specific Table<a name="reference_policies_examples_dynamodb_specific-table"></a>

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows full access to a DynamoDB table with the specified name\. To use this policy, replace the red text in the example policy with your own information\.

**Important**  
This policy allows all actions that can be performed on a DynamoDB table\. To review these actions, see [DynamoDB API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/api-permissions-reference.html) in the* Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*\. You could provide the same permissions by listing each individual action\. However, if you use the `"Action":"dynamodb:*"` element, then you will not need to update your policy if DynamoDB adds a new action for DynamoDB tables\. 

This policy allows actions only on DynamoDB tables that exist with the specified name\. To allow your users `Read` access to everything in DynamoDB, you can also attach the [AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess) AWS managed policy\.
